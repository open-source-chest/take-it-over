# Take It Over

A list of open-source project looking for a new maintainer/lead developer.

## How it works

1. Look through the list of available projects
2. Take a close look at interesting projects
3. Make sure your have enough free time to maintain the project
4. Write to the current maintainer (using linked Github account)
5. If all agree, the repository will probably be moved to an own organisation
6. The current maintainer will support you very intensively in the beginning so you will know how to use the git workflow, versions, builds, deployments, etc.


## Rules

1. You agree to not change the license to something properitary
2. You agree to maintain the project as best as you can (taking over a project only for the reputation is a no-go)
3. The current maintainer helps your in the beginning to get things going.

## Why?

Why would you do that? Let me give you some points:

1. Your whole (technical) life is based on open-source. Giving something back is simply fair.
2. You get some reputation by supporting/maintaining well used open-source projects. Companies like developer that are dedicated to open-source projects.
3. You increase your know-how automatically.
